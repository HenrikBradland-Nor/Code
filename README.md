This is the code related to my project in IKT446. 

The goal of the project is to use reinforcement learning to acquire locomotion within a snake-like robot.

The code combines RLlib with Apoen AI's GYM to form a framework for machine learning. The code is then linked with an API to Coppelia Sim that works as a physics simulator.


# Code
 Code for snake project

The two environments are as follows:
- myCode/snake_env/envs/imitationEnv.py 
  (for the imitation learning process)

- myCode/snake_env/envs/snakeEnv.py
  (for conection with simulator)

The main file for RL:
- myCode/imitationLearning.py
